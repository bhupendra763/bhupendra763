# Bhupendra Singh Gour
### Backend Software Engineer (Java | Spring Boot)  
Data Scientist | AI/ML Engineer  
Python • ML • Deep Learning • Kubernetes

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋 
Hi! I'm Bhupendra Singh Gour — a results-driven Software Engineer who thrives on building scalable, high-performance applications powered by intelligent technologies. My expertise spans across Java and Spring Boot for backend development, and Python with Flask for building data-driven AI systems.

Passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I’m constantly exploring how automation, predictive analytics, and Deep Learning can reshape user experiences and decision-making. I also work with modern DevOps tools like Kubernetes and Docker to ensure seamless deployment and scalability of production-ready applications.

My technical stack includes MySQL for relational data management and Git for version control — enabling collaboration, continuous integration, and clean software delivery. I believe in writing code that’s efficient, maintainable, and built to solve real-world problems.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring geopolitics and international affairs, practicing javelin throw, gaming, and sharing creative ideas with friends.
